# Nessus Vulnerability Scanner

This lab was to use a vulnerability scanner to constantly go through systems to make sure it has not been tampered with. In the case of these samples there is any problems practice incident response and go through the proper steps to indicate and solve the problem.


## How it Works
 
 The software is an Intruder Detection System(IDS) that will constantly detect the system for any critcal errors. The detection works by filling the system with a proper IP address and read the system's apps for problems. You can reference the PNG attached to the REPO


 ### Goal
  This lab was to demonstrate my focus on a strong Security Posture for the critcal systems of the company. My ability to quickly and correctly assess to the problems and solve them so the company can work smoothly inside out. This can be set to scan automatically and notify the user incase something does popup to increase my efficency at the desk.
